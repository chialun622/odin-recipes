        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <li>2 (5 ounce) ahi tuna steaks</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>

         <h2>Steps</h2>   
          <ol>
            <li>Season chicken breasts on both sides with salt and pepper. Place flour, beaten egg, and panko crumbs into separate shallow dishes. Coat chicken breasts in flour, shaking off any excess; dip into egg, and then press into panko crumbs until well coated on both sides.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place chicken in the hot oil, and fry until golden brown, 3 or 4 minutes per side. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.</li>
